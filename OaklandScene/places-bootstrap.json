We serve approximately 25,000 students in Kindergarten through Grade 12 in 59 schools. In addition, Early Childhood programs serve three- and four-year-olds in classrooms across the city.\r\n\r\nWe believe that every child\u2014at every level of academic performance\u2014can achieve excellence. Only by focusing on what we can best control \u2013 improving performance at every level of the organization \u2013 can we honor our obligation to prepare every student to take maximum advantage of The Pittsburgh Promise \u00ae while also preparing our public school system to be better able to thrive in an era of unprecedented competition.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of our Excellence for All reform agenda in 2006, we have put in place key elements to improve student achievement, including:\r\n-a rigorous new PreK-12 curriculum; \r\n-a nationally recognized program to recruit, train, support and compensate \r\n-principals as instructional leaders; and \r\n-expanded early childhood offerings so a child's school experience gets off to a better start when transitioning to Kindergarten.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that our Excellence For All reform efforts are showing promising results for all of our children. In 2011, Pittsburgh Public Schools made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) for the second time in the past three years. Making AYP twice is a formidable accomplishment for an urban school district in just nine years since the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was signed into law in January 2002. As a result, the District will move into Making Progress status under NCLB for the 2011-12 school year. Achieving AYP means that the District met all of its targets on each of three standards \u2013 high school graduation, test participation and academic performance. \r\n\r\nIn terms of academic performance, results from the 2011 Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) show that more District students are on track to Promise-Readiness as gains in reading and mathematics proficiency increased on 11 of 14 tests. The number of students performing at the advanced level increased on 10 of 14 tests, while the number of students performing below basic decreased on 13 of 14 PSSA tests. \r\n\r\nAccording to Superintendent Linda Lane, the District's overarching goal is to get students Promise-Ready and prepared for success after graduation, \u201cWe know that significant progress doesn't happen overnight. While the PSSA results offer evidence that our efforts to improve academic performance are taking hold, we also know that the only way more of our students will become Promise-Ready is if we remain committed to our work to ensure that an effective teacher is in every classroom, every day.\u201d \r\n\r\nOver the past four years, the percent of students scoring proficient or advanced has increased on all 14 PSSA exams. While evidence indicates that current reforms are working, the District remains committed to being a continuous learning organization that will making adjustments based on data and results.\r\n\r\nIf you are new to Pittsburgh, you're moving to a new neighborhood, or your child is entering Pittsburgh Public Schools for the first time, visit the Registration/Enrollment page on the District's website www.pps.k12.pa.us.\r\n\r\nIf you need additional help, please use Contact Us or call the Parent Hotline at 412-622-7920.", "events": [], "fb_id": "294241040320", "hours": [], "id": "93", "image": "/media/cache/d6/c2/d6c210ba3be838dc9a0df5df6821ffa1.jpg", "listed": true, "location": {"address": "341 S Bellefield Ave", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.445093, "longitude": -79.951246, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Board of Public Education", "phone": "(412) 622-3770", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/place/93/", "specials": [], "twitter_username": "", "url": "http://www.pghboe.net/pps/site/default.asp"}, {"categories": [{"id": "1", "label": "Food & Drink"}, {"id": "2", "label": "Retail"}], "description": "", "events": [], "fb_id": "", "hours": [], "id": "252", "image": "/media/cache/0a/fc/0afce85dccb5170feee934dc71fd06f8.jpg", "listed": true, "location": {"address": "4605 Centre Ave", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.45205, "longitude": -79.951792, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Bombay Food Market", "phone": "", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/place/252/", "specials": [], "twitter_username": "", "url": "http://abombay.com/index.html"}, {"categories": [], "description": "", "events": [], "fb_id": "", "hours": [], "id": "179", "image": "/media/cache/3d/26/3d26cf4cecffdd6aef8462b618ef9743.jpg", "listed": true, "location": {"address": "403 Semple St", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.437056, "longitude": -79.954734, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Bootlegger's", "phone": "(412) 682-3060", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/place/179/", "specials": [], "twitter_username": "", "url": ""}, {"categories": [{"id": "1", "label": "Food & Drink"}], "description": "It all started with the bagel.

In fact, the term \"fast casual\" didn't even exist. The only option for busy people and families on the go was the fast food drive thru window. Not exactly a healthy or wholesome option. Our founder Aaron Kennedy was living in New York City at the time and asked the question, \"Why not?\" Why couldn't a restaurant bridge the gap and offer convenience and fresh, flavorful food. Radical thinking, right? \r\nBeing in one of the restaurant capitals of the world, Aaron also saw a lot of niche restaurants-Italian, American, Chinese-but that required everyone to be in the mood for the same thing. So he asked himself another question, \"Why not offer all of these great flavors under one roof?\" But there was something missing. There had to be an anchor, something that would tie the concept together. Enter the noodle. Noodles and pasta are part of almost every cuisine-from Pad Thai in Thailand to Lo Mein in China to Mac & Cheese in Wisconsin. So why not put the world's best loved noodle and pasta dishes on one menu and serve them fast and fresh? \r\nFast forward to 1995 and that's what he did. What started as a single restaurant in the Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver, Colorado has now grown to hundreds of restaurants nationwide.
