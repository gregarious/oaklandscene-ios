Moriarty Science Seminar Series- scientific seminars on current research at Carnegie Museum of Natural History! Hear Carnegie scientists and invited researchers discuss their latest findings on a wide variety of science topics.\r\n\r\nFor more than twenty years, Chris Beard and his colleagues have been searching for clues about the geographic and phylogenetic origins of Anthropoidea (the clade that now includes monkeys, apes, and humans). Beard's research has been driven by paleontological f\r\nieldwork in Asia (China and Myanmar) and Africa (Libya). Results show that previous hypotheses supporting an African origin for anthropoids are incorrect. The anthropoid clade arose in Asia no later than the middle Eocene and colonized Africa no later than the late middle Eocene. The colonization of Africa by early anthropoids may itself have stimulated rapid diversification and morphological innovation within the anthropoid clade, possibly leading to the modern anthropoid bauplan. Recent results of Beard's work in Myanmar and Libya show that the colonization of Africa by early anthropoids was not a simple affair, either biogeographically or phylogenetically. At least two clades of early anthropoids colonized Africa from Asia, possibly at the same time. Hystricognathous rodents show a similar phylogenetic, biogeographic, and temporal pattern of distribution. The underlying biological and/or geological factors contributing to this large-scale pattern remain largely unknown, however.\r\n\r\nChris Beard is curator of vertebrate paleontology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History and director of its Center for Evolutionary Studies. Beard\u2019s formal education includes undergraduate majors in zoology and anthropology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a PhD in functional anatomy and evolution from The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. Beard conducts original field and laboratory research focusing on the phylogeny and biogeography of early Cenozoic mammals in relation to perturbations of the physical environment. A specialist on early primates and the origin of anthropoids, Beard is the author of the award-winning book The Hunt for the Dawn Monkey: Unearthing the Origins of Monkeys, Apes and Humans (University of California Press, 2004).\r\n\r\nCost: Free with museum admission, no registration required.\r\nLocation: Earth Theater\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Science Seminars, contact Curator John Rawlins at 412.688.8668 or email RawlinsJ@carnegiemnh.org.", "dtcreated": "2012-09-27T01:45:30.452185+00:00", "dtend": "2012-10-03T17:00:00+00:00", "dtmodified": "2012-09-27T01:45:30.452248+00:00", "dtstart": "2012-10-03T16:00:00+00:00", "id": "241", "image": null, "listed": true, "name": "Seminar Series- Into Africa: New constraints on the anthropoid colonization of Africa", "place": {"id": "198", "location": {"address": "4400 Forbes Ave", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.443628, "longitude": -79.950626, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Carnegie Museum of Natural History", "resource_uri": ""}, "place_primitive": "", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/event/241/", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/events/153247348147639/"}, {"allday": false, "categories": [{"id": "5", "label": "Food"}], "description": "Join us for Farmers at Phipps to shop for certified organic and Certified Naturally Grown products from local purveyors offering farm-fresh vegetables, fruit, meat, cheese, eggs, honey, seedlings, cut flowers, perennials, and more on our historic and sustainably managed front lawn.  \r\n\r\n2012 Vendors\r\n\r\nBlackberry Meadows Farm\r\nChurch View Farm\r\nClarion River Organics\r\nFriendship Farms\r\nGreen Circle Farm\r\nMott Family Farm\r\nPancake Maples\r\nProspect Meadow Berry Farm\r\nSonshine Farm\r\nUna Biologicals", "dtcreated": "2012-08-22T06:28:08.932714+00:00", "dtend": "2012-10-03T22:30:00+00:00", "dtmodified": "2012-08-22T06:28:08.932766+00:00", "dtstart": "2012-10-03T18:30:00+00:00", "id": "145", "image": "/media/cache/5c/26/5c2634c82ef4c64a01150c034383ab4f.jpg", "listed": true, "name": "Farmers at Phipps", "place": {"id": "230", "location": {"address": "1 Schenley Dr", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.439093, "longitude": -79.947487, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Phipps Conservatory & Botanical Gardens", "resource_uri": ""}, "place_primitive": "", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/event/145/", "url": "http://phipps.conservatory.org/exhibits-and-events/featured-event.aspx?eventid=324"}, {"allday": false, "categories": [{"id": "3", "label": "Lecture"}], "description": "Speaker: Alexander Cooley, Columbia University\r\nLocation: \t4217 Posvar Hall \r\nAnnounced by: Asian Studies Center, Center for Russian and East European Studies\r\nCost: Free\r\n\r\nThe struggle between Russia and Great Britain over Central Asia in the nineteenth century was the original \"great game.\" But in the past quarter century, a new \"great game\" has emerged, pitting America against a newly aggressive Russia and a resource-hungry China, all struggling for influence over one of the volatile areas in the world. In Great Games, Local Rules, Alexander Cooley, one of America's most respected Central Asia experts, explores the dynamics of the new competition over the region since 9/11. All three great powers are pursuing important goals: basing rights and security cooperation for the US, access to energy for the Chinese, and increased political influence for the Russians. But Central Asian governments have proven themselves powerful forces in their own right, establishing local rules that serve to fend off foreign demands and pare down external conditions, enrich themselves and reinforce their sovereign authority. Cooley's careful and surprising explanation of how small states interact with great powers in this vital region greatly advances our understanding of how world politics actually works in this contemporary era of diminishing Western influence and rising new regional powers.\r\n\r\nAlexander Cooley is the Tow Professor for Distinguished Scholars and Practitioners in Political Science at Barnard College, Columbia University in New York. Professor Cooley's research examines how external actors have shaped the sovereignty and political development of the post-Communist states, with a focus on post-Soviet Central Asia and the Caucasus. He is the author of dozens of articles and four academic books- the most recent, Great Games, Local Rules: The New Great Power Contest in Central Asia examines US-Russia-China relations in the region from 2001-2011 and will be published in July 2012 by Oxford University Press. In addition to his academic work, Cooley's policy-related articles and opinion pieces have appeared in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs and he is regularly quoted in international media outlets on Central Asia-related topics. Professor Cooley currently serves on the Board of Advisors of the Open Society Foundations\u2019 Central Eurasia Project, the Advisory Committee of Human Rights Watch, Division of Europe and Central Asia, and has testified before the US Congress about the politics surrounding the Manas base in Kyrgyzstan. His work has been supported by grants and fellowships with the German Marshall Fund of the United States, the Smith Richardson Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation and the Open Society Foundations, among others.\r\n", "dtcreated": "2012-09-27T02:26:56.153053+00:00", "dtend": "2012-10-04T18:00:00+00:00", "dtmodified": "2012-09-27T02:26:56.153107+00:00", "dtstart": "2012-10-04T16:00:00+00:00", "id": "251", "image": "/media/cache/63/0b/630bfb61972484f6b5cfb7b92e6fab50.jpg", "listed": true, "name": "The Price of Influence: Geopolitical Competition and Human Rights in Central Asia, 2001-2012", "place": {"id": "384", "location": {"address": "", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.441628, "longitude": -79.953842, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Posvar Hall", "resource_uri": ""}, "place_primitive": "", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/event/251/", "url": "http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/comet/presentColloquium.do?col_id=3651"}, {"allday": false, "categories": [{"id": "3", "label": "Lecture"}], "description": "Seating is limited.

We find that decisions about distant-future events are more likely to generate discrimination against women and minorities (relative to Caucasian males) than are decisions about near-future events. In our study, faculty members received e-mails from fictional prospective doctoral students seeking to schedule a meeting either that day or in 1 week; students? names signaled their race (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Indian, or Chinese) and gender. When the requests were to meet in 1 week, Caucasian males were granted access to faculty members 26% more often than were women and minorities; also, compared with women and minorities, Caucasian males received more and faster responses. However, these patterns were essentially eliminated when prospective students requested a meeting that same day. Our identification of a ?temporal discrimination effect? is consistent with the predictions of construal-level theory and implies that subtle contextual shifts can alter patterns of race- and gender-based discrimination. In addition to exploring when discrimination occurs, we also examine where in academia discrimination is most pronounced. We find that discrimination varies meaningfully by discipline and is more extreme in higher paying disciplines and at private (higher paying) institutions. These findings raise important questions for future research about how and why pay and institutional characteristics may relate to the manifestation of bias. They also suggest that past audit studies may have underestimated the prevalence of discrimination in the United States. Finally, our documentation of heterogeneity in discrimination suggests where targeted efforts to reduce discrimination in academia are most needed and highlights that similar research may help identify areas in other industries where efforts to reduce bias should focus.", "dtcreated": "2012-09-27T02:36:36.013900+00:00", "dtend": "2012-10-11T17:15:00+00:00", "dtmodified": "2012-09-27T02:36:36.013958+00:00", "dtstart": "2012-10-11T16:00:00+00:00", "id": "253", "image": "/media/cache/13/4c/134ceda626ea086a5c56fc2122337e8e.jpg", "listed": true, "name": " The When and Where of Discrimination: An Audit Study in Academia   ", "place": {"id": "289", "location": {"address": "", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.44143, "longitude": -79.944653, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Porter Hall", "resource_uri": ""}, "place_primitive": "", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/event/253/", "url": "http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/comet/presentColloquium.do?col_id=3624"}, {"allday": false, "categories": [{"id": "3", "label": "Lecture"}], "description": "Speaker: Sam Kean, Independent writer\r\n\r\nLocation: \tCarnegie Mellon University, Porter Hall #100\r\n\r\nWhy did Gandhi hate iodine?

Despite decades of revitalization, Pittsburgh still ranks as one of the most polluted cities in the United States, with higher rates of cancer, asthma, and obesity than the national averages.\r\n\r\nImperfect Health features a wide range of works, including photographs, sculpture, video, research and archival materials, design projects, architectural models and drawings, that together examine the complex relationships between design and health. The exhibition includes works by an international group of architects, artists, designers, and institutions.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the exhibition are a book extending the research (published by CCA with Lars M\u00fcller and available as an e-book and in print in the gallery), an online TV channel, and public programs including a lecture series, panel discussions, screenings and tours.", "dtcreated": "2012-08-29T14:05:18.742412+00:00", "dtend": "2013-02-25T01:00:00+00:00", "dtmodified": "2012-08-29T14:05:18.742470+00:00", "dtstart": "2012-09-15T20:30:00+00:00", "id": "198", "image": "/media/cache/40/c4/40c434b5162da58c902f6cdb21a79fba.jpg", "listed": true, "name": "IMPERFECT HEALTH: The Medicalization of Architecture", "place": {"id": "406", "location": {"address": "5000 Forbes Ave", "country": "US", "latitude": 40.444423, "longitude": -79.942984, "postcode": "15213", "state": "PA", "town": "Pittsburgh"}, "name": "Purnell Center for the Arts", "resource_uri": ""}, "place_primitive": "", "resource_uri": "/api/v1/event/198/", "url": "http://millergallery.cfa.cmu.edu/exhibitions/imperfecthealth/"}]}
